6.2. Draft order will be determined by the members of each individual league so long as the order is agreed by majority vote to be sufficiently random.

6.2b. The draft order may be either completely random or pick position may be chosen by individual members provided the order in which the members are able to pick is randomly generated.

6.3. The draft will be 15 rounds in a snake format.

6.4. Draft picks cannot be traded.

6.5. There are no requirements to fill every starting position.

6.6. If a member cannot attend the draft and it is acceptable to them, they may appoint a designee that is not within the same league to draft for them or they may autodraft.

6.7. League drafts will start at the agreed upon time. It is the member's responsibility to make sure they are available.

## 7. Waivers

7.1. Waivers will open up immediately upon the conclusion of the draft.

7.2. FFDiscord Association leagues will operate under a FAAB system.  Bids will be processed overnight Tuesday. Any remaining players after bids are processed will be free agents.

7.4. The minimum bid for a waiver is $0.

7.5. If there is a tie between multiple teams on the amount bid for a player, the tiebreaker is determined by the inverse order of standings.

7.6. It is expected that all players in the NFL universe may be rostered. This rule may be dependent on the hosting site in question. FFDiscord Association commissioners do not have control over adding players into the system that are missing.

7.7. There is no limit on the number of acquisitions that can be performed over the season.

## 8. Trading

8.1. Trades will open up immediately upon the conclusion of the draft, and will remain open until the trade deadline, which is in week 10 of the NFL season.

8.2. Trades will not have a review period (effective immediately when accepted) and will be conducted under the integrity system.

9.3. There are no divisions within a league. All teams will be in a single group.

9.4. Weekly head-to-head matchups will be determined by the points scored by a team's starters.

## 10. Valid Lineups

10.1. Lineups lock individually at scheduled game time.

10.2. Each team is expected to field a valid lineup (no bye week players, no players on IR). See rule 10.5 for situations where an empty lineup slot is allowed.

10.3. In the event of a computer failure, the league member must contact a Commissioner via Discord to request a lineup substitution.  The substitution must be made prior to each player locking.  The lineup substitution request must not be an edited message so the timestamp can be verified. In the event of a request made before a lock, but the commissioner cannot address it before it locks, the commissioner will inform the member’s opponent of the situation, and retroactively set the lineup.

10.4. Empty lineup slots are permitted for strategic purposes. Examples include, but not limited to: benching a Monday night player when they are ahead of their opponent who does not have any more active players, not playing a kicker because they don't want to drop a player, playing a player on bye because they don't want to drop a player. Players that are going to play an empty lineup spot for strategic purposes need to declare their intent to a Commissioner or in the main FFDiscord Association channel.

10.5. Members that do not field a valid lineup must explain their reason, whether it be intentional or unintentional, before waivers clear the following week. Members that fail to do this will have their team considered abandoned, and eligible for mid-season replacement.

10.5b. If a member explains their reason after their team becomes eligible for mid-season replacement but before the team has been reassigned to a new owner, the Commissioners may remove the team's eligibility for mid-season replacement and leave the team with the original owner at their discretion.

10.6. Teams eligible for mid-season replacement will be filled in the following order:
1. Potential members that waitlisted for the FFDiscord Association but did not receive a team.
2. Potential members that volunteer to take over the team based on a notification on the team's eligibility to receive a new owner on the Discord server.

10.6b. If a team eligible for mid-season replacement does not have an owner in time for upcoming games, the Commissioners will set the roster based on maximizing projected fantasy points listed on the website. No roster swaps will be made; this may cause a team to not field a valid lineup, particularly if a kicker or D/ST is on bye.

10.7. Members that fill a team mid-season will be given priority registration for the following season.

## 11. Tiebreakers

11.1. There are no tiebreaker settings for regular season matches as fractional scoring does not frequently yield ties.

11.2. Tiebreakers for playoff seeds are broken in the following order:
1. Highest Overall Record
2. Most Points For
3. Most Points Against

11.3. If a playoff match is tied, then the higher seed will advance.

## 12. Playoffs

12.1. The playoffs will begin with NFL Week 14 and end at the conclusion of NFL Week 16.

12.2. The six teams with the best regular season records within each individual league will be eligible for the playoffs. Ties are broken based on the tiebreaking system in rule 11.2.

12.3. The top two seeds will receive a bye in the first round.

12.4. Playoff matches will be one-week playoff games.

## 13. League Hierarchy

13.1. The FFDiscord Association is distributed into two "tiers": Tier One, and Tier Two. Tier One consists of a single 12-member league, known as the Champions League. Tier Two consists of multiple 12-member leagues, and can vary in quantity of leagues from season to season.

13.2. At the beginning of each season, all eligible members that are not within Tier One will be placed into one of the leagues within Tier Two. Placement in those leagues is done by random draw.

13.3. Members only play against opponents within his or her league.

13.4. There is only one champion per league (i.e. no ties or co-champions).

## 14. Promotion/Relegation

14.1. At the end of each season, a certain number of top and bottom members in each league will be promoted/relegated to the next higher/lower tier. These promotion and relegation zones are set at the beginning of the season, with sizes determined by roster size of the given and proximal tier and association pyramid structure.

14.1b. With three leagues within Tier Two, the Champion's League bottom six finishers in the final standings will be relegated down to Tier Two. The top two finishers based on the playoffs in each league in Tier Two will be promoted to the Champions League the following season.

14.2. In the case of any vacancy in the Champions League before the start of the season, the first open spot will be given to one of the members that was the highest-finishing, non-promoting member in their Tier Two league at the end of the season and meets all other requirements for membership. That member is drawn at random from the pool of members that are eligible. Subsequent spots will be drawn at random until that pool of members is exhausted. If further spots are needed, the process will be repeated with members that were the second-highest-finishing, non-promoting member in their Tier Two league at the end of the season. This will continue until there is a full roster of 12 for the Champions League.

14.3. Under no circumstance will a member who finishes in the relegation zone of a tier return to that tier the following season (except during seasons which involve significant member realignment).

14.4. The promotion and relegation criteria for a given season will be determined and published before the start of the season.

## 15. Rookie Members

15.1. New members to the FFDiscord Association will begin in Tier Two.

## 16. Re-Entry

16.1. If a member leaves the league for a season, when applying for re-entry, their past seasons will not count towards priority placement.

16.2. Members removed from the FFDiscord Association for disciplinary reasons must be approved by a majority of the commissioners in order to be readmitted to the league.

## 17. League Growth and Expansion

17.1. In future seasons, as the number of members increases, leagues will be added in Tier Two to accommodate the growth.

## 18. Player Conduct

18.1. Don't be a jerk, and be respectful to others. Abuse, disrespect, and assholishness are not tolerated. Don't rage quit and drop all of your players when your team is out of the playoffs.

18.2. Failure to comply with rule 10.1 is grounds for removal from the league. Warnings can optionally be provided by commissioners, but are not required to be removed from the league.

## 19. Rules

19.1. Any situation not covered within the rules outlined above will be determined by the Commissioners of the Association.  Their decision is final.

19.1b. If there is any rule clarification that directly involves a commissioner, the commissioner in question will recuse himself from the decision.

19.1c. If the ruling in question is pertinent to all leagues, these rules may be amended by the Commissioners for clarification going forward.

19.2. Any rules changes may be suggested to the Commissioners by players, but all rules changes will ultimately be determined by the Commissioners.
